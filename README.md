⚠️ **Warning**

The current ECS version **should not be used**.  
It did not pass my performance tests and does not meet the intended goals.

I am currently working on a **new architecture (V2)** based on **bitsets** and **archetypes**, with performance as a primary focus.

👉 You can follow the progress in the **Architecture-V2** directory/branch.  
The **main** branch will be updated once the new architecture is fully functional.
